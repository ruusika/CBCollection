# CBCollection Fabric Mod for Minecraft
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-work_in_progress-blue)

## How it started

The idea of this mod was sprouted on a now closed RP-Project server. Playing an innkeeper and cook I had 40 min videos or a copy of the modpack in curseforge at my disposal to keep track of how the many dishes are crafted. *Too many if you are asking.* There was the guidebook from croptopia but that one is heavily outdated. Most roleplay servers I was on prohibit the use of JEI (Just Enough Items) or REI (Roughly Enough Items) and some mods work with JEI only or REI only. *Annoying as hell*

So I started working on my first new recipe book with [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli).  I was sick of skipping through an (outdated) 40 minute video every time so I created "A Delight Cookbook" - based on Farmer's Delight. It was well recieved and found it's way into the successor project. So I thought: "Why not expand this for the most common food mods and provide compatibility along the way?"
